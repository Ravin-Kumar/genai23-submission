Description
==
PhiloGPT is a GenAI application using OpenAI's GPT4 and the Stanford Philosophy Encyclopedia to bridge the gap between philosophy and accessibility. It aims to make philosophical texts more accessible to a wider audience by utilising generative AI capabilities.

Often, philosophical texts can be dense and difficult to understand for those without a background in the field. This is why we have created PhiloGPT to summarise and simplify complex philosophical ideas into easier to understand language.
